Package: cloud-initramfs-rescuevol
Architecture: all
Depends: initramfs-tools, ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: boot off a rescue volume rather than root filesystem
 This package adds functionality to an initramfs built by initramfs-tools.
 When installed the initramfs will check to see if any partitions
 with a label of 'RESCUE_VOL' are attached.  If such a volume is attached,
 it will boot off that volume rather than the root volume.
 .
 This is useful in a cloud environment, when the user is able to attach
 and detach volumes to a running system, but has no other mechanism
 for interupting of fixing a failed boot.  It is analogous to inserting
 a rescue CD into a system to recover from failure.

Package: cloud-initramfs-growroot

Description: automatically resize the root partition on first boot
 This package adds functionality to an initramfs built by initramfs-tools.
 When installed, the initramfs will repartition a disk to make the
 root volume consume all space that follows it.
 .
 You most likely do not want this package unless you know what you are
 doing.  It is primarily interesting in a virtualized environment when
 a disk can provisioned with a size larger than its original size.
 In this case, with this package installed, you can automatically use
 the new space without requiring a reboot to re-read the partition table.

Description: use an overlayfs on top of a read-only root filesystem
 This package adds functionality to an initramfs built by initramfs-tools.
 When installed and configured, the initramfs will mount an overlayfs
 filesystem on top of a read-only root volume.
 .
 The changes can be written to a in-memory temporary filesystem, a
 filesystem on an existing block device, or a dmcrypt encrypted block
 device.

Package: cloud-initramfs-dyn-netconf
Architecture: all
Depends: initramfs-tools, ${misc:Depends}, ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: write a network interface file in /run for BOOTIF
 This package provides an initramfs module that will write a simple
 network interfaces formated file to /run/network/interfaces with
 entries for any devices that were configured during initramfs.

Package: cloud-initramfs-copymods
Architecture: all
Depends: initramfs-tools,
         ${misc:Depends},
         ${shlibs:Depends}
Description: copy initramfs modules into root filesystem for later use
 When booting with an external-to-root kernel and initramfs, you need
 to ensure that /lib/modules contains any necessary modules not already
 loaded.
 .
 This package arranges for the modules in the initramfs to be placed
 into /lib/modules after the switchroot is done.
